# How to properly inform your students to find sources
Quick note: This page is more focused at correcting good source finding in general than it is at the specific topic this website covers (TLDs being meaningless).

## Why you are full of bullshit

### Understand TLDs
Remember that: 

* .com, .net, .org: All available for anyone to register at any time.
* .edu: Only available to educational institutions, as well as a handful of grandfathered-in domains (america.edu is one such domain)
* .gov: Available to government agencies and people with relevant reason to get one.

But, at the same time, remember that:

* Many amazing and incredibly helpful websites exist on .com, .net, or .org; including National Geographic, Discovery Education, and Khan Academy.
* Many schools give students hosting to whatever they want, which can include random blogs and rants as well as amazing projects like Folding@Home.
* Non-government agencies can register .govs and do whatever they want with them, they're just expensive.

Simply put, a domain's TLD does not actually mean anything.

### The internet is a big place

The internet is a big place, it's a big part of today's society, and it's not going anywhere.

By not teaching students (well, anyone really) to properly use it, and instead teaching bullshit, you are actively harming an entire generation of people. You wouldn't tell your students to only trust books that have black text on a white background, because that's obviously stupid and wrong. So why are you doing the same thing with the internet?

## How to properly teach
So how do we fix this? Well...

### Teach students to regonize credible sources and not credible sources
This should be standard cirriculum whereever oyu live, but if it isn't *please* work it in. The internet means that we have more information available to us than ever before, but at the same time that information isn't nessisarily true, and it's important to be able to identify good and bad sources.

[Timecube][timecube] obviously isn't a good source (unless you're writing a paper on Timecube), but it has a lot of the same qualities. It has lots of writing, and even has infographics, but all the writing is complete bullshit. But most bad sources aren't as obvious, and if your students can't distinguish a good source from a bad source, then they're just going to be another person on Facebook spouting about how posting a block of text on their Wall prevents Facebook from harvesting all their data.

Intentionally deceptive fake sources don't happen that often. They do happen, but really on the internet they get sorted out relatively quickly (see also: "the quickest way to get the correct answer on the internet is to ask the question and give a wrong answer"), and aren't a signifigant problem.

### Wikipedia
"Wikipedia is awful!" you scream. "Anyone can edit it!" you holler. "Shut the hell up" we all scream back.

Wikipedia is a free (as in freedom) encyclopedia. This is the first ever of it's kind, and is one of humanity's greatest achievements in knowledge. At the same time, anyone can edit it, so it's obviously full of lies, right?

No. Of course not.

Wikipedia has a large team of editors, some are paid by the Wikimedia Foundation to moderate Wikipedia, some are paid by other groups to maintain certain topics, but the vast majority are unpaid people working in their spare time to help keep Wikipedia useful. It's this team of moderators that keeps Wikipedia clean of crap, as [over 40% of vandilism is reverted nearly immediately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ClueBot_NG#Statistics), and the rest doesn't last too long. However, Wikipedia still isn't a good citing source, but it is an incredible tool.

Sourced encyclopedias aren't a good citing source to begin with. They're a cited secondary source, meaning that the information didn't actually come from whoever wrote the article in it. However, they're an amazing tool for finding sources. Sure, the Wikipedia article for [Benjamin Franklin][wikiben] might be wrong, but there's [over 150 sources there][wikibensources], most of which are online, available for anyone to read and verify the article.

Wikipedia also has [extensive edit histories][wikibenhistory] for every single article on the site. Some articles are also [semi-protected or protected][wikiprotection], meaning they can only be edited by email-verified members or moderators respectively. Anyone can still submit edits, but they must be manually approved before showing up. Most signifigant people, espeically living ones, are at least semi-protected, meaning they have a signifigantly lower chance of being vandalized than an unprotected article.

You've almost certainly heard stories of a Wikipedia "[feedback loop][xkcd978]", where someone edits in a fake piece of information, a lazy journalist uses it in an article, and then that article is cited as the source to that fake piece of information. It's happened before, and it will likely happen again, but it's important to remember that it *very* rarely happens, and when it does it's usually caught. I also see this as a great oppertunity to talk to your students about journalistic integrity, and how a lot of (but not all) modern journalists aren't very good at that.

Encourage your students to use Wikipedia to find sources, or to even use for a source on smaller assignements, so long as they check the article's edit history, and check around to make sure that the information in the article is correct, and isn't the result of a feedback loop, deliberate misinformation, or any other source of bad info.

### Walled Garden Tools
EBSCO (and its sisters) are shit, and are useless to everyone. It hides all the bad sources from students, meaning they can never learn how to properly disgintuish them. You wouldn't tell a student to only trust books from your school library, because they can't access it after they leave school, and you don't even know if everything there is completely true.

Walled garden tools are still useful, as sometimes you just don't want to deal with finding good sources, but it's important to teach students the context they live under.

### Citing Google
99% of cites to "Google" are wrong and should be fixed. Finding a result in a Google search does not mean the source is Google. Citing an image as coming from "Google" is useless unless it actually came from Google Inc.

(This isn't really related to the scope of this website, but it is related to the scope of this page, and is something a lot of teachers haven't learned).

## The Takeaway / TL;DR
So, Princess Twilight, what have we learned today?

* TLDs are meaningless
* Wikipedia is incredibly useful, when used correctly
* Google isn't a source

Hopefully you'll take this information and help yourself and others to properly find and utilize sources.
